                        Sem Green peas, or “garden peas,” are the small, spherical seeds that come

                        are not vegetables. They are part of the legume family, which consists of
                        plants that produce pods with seeds inside. Lentils, chickpeas, beans and
                        peanuts are also legumes. However, green peas are commonly cooked and sold
                        as a vegetable. There are several different varieties of peas available,
                        including yellow peas, black-eyed peas and purple peas. However, green peas
                        are the most frequently consumed. Snap peas and snow peas are other popular
                        varieties that are often confused with green peas due to their similar

                        Sem Oats are a whole-grain food, known scientifically as Avena sativa. Oat
                        groats, the most intact and whole form of oats, take a long time to cook.
                        For this reason, most people prefer rolled, crushed or steel-cut oats.
                        Instant (quick) oats are the most highly processed variety. While they take
                        the shortest time to cook, the texture may be mushy. Oats are commonly eaten
                        for breakfast as oatmeal, which is made by boiling oats in water or milk.
                        Oatmeal is often referred to as porridge. They’re also often included in
                        muffins, granola bars, cookies and other baked goods. *BENEFITS OF OAT*

                        Sem Almonds contain vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber, and so they may
                        offer a number of health benefits. Just a handful of almonds — approximately
                        1 ounce — contains one-eighth of a person’s daily protein needs. People can
                        eat almonds raw or toasted as a snack or add them to sweet or savory dishes.
                        They are also available sliced, flaked, slivered, as flour, oil, butter, or
                        almond milk. People call almonds a nut, but they are seeds, rather than a
                        true nut. Almond trees may have been one of the earliest trees that people
                        cultivated. In Jordan, archaeologists have found evidence of domesticated
                        almond trees dating back some 5,000 years. *Benefits of Almond* ¶Almonds

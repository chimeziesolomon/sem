                        <p>
                        Sem Green peas, or “garden peas,” are the small, spherical seeds that come from pods produced
                         by the Pisum sativum plant. Strictly speaking, green peas are not vegetables. They are part of 
                         the legume family, which consists of plants that produce pods with seeds inside. Lentils,
                          chickpeas, beans and peanuts are also legumes. However, green peas are commonly cooked 
                          and sold as a vegetable. There are several different varieties of peas available, including 
                          yellow peas, black-eyed peas and purple peas. However, green peas are the most frequently 
                          consumed. Snap peas and snow peas are other popular varieties that are often confused with
                           green peas due to their similar appearance. However, their flavor and nutrient content differ 
                           slightly.

                        <p>
                        Sem Oats are a whole-grain food, known scientifically as Avena sativa.

                        Oat groats, the most intact and whole form of oats, take a long time to cook. For this reason, most people prefer rolled, crushed or steel-cut oats.

                        Instant (quick) oats are the most highly processed variety. While they take the shortest time to cook, the texture may be mushy.

                        Oats are commonly eaten for breakfast as oatmeal, which is made by boiling oats in water or milk. Oatmeal is often referred to as porridge.

                        They’re also often included in muffins, granola bars, cookies and other baked goods.

                        <h4>Sem Almond</h4>
                        <p>
                        Sem Almonds contain vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber, and so they may offer a number of health benefits. Just a handful of almonds — approximately 1 ounce — contains one-eighth of a person’s daily protein needs.

                        People can eat almonds raw or toasted as a snack or add them to sweet or savory dishes. They are also available sliced, flaked, slivered, as flour, oil, butter, or almond milk.

                        People call almonds a nut, but they are seeds, rather than a true nut.

                        Almond trees may have been one of the earliest trees that people cultivated. In Jordan, archaeologists have found evidence of domesticated almond trees dating back some 5,000 years.
